            <p>During my senior year of high school, I began my journey into entrepreneurship by reselling my clothes before heading off to college. Initially, it was just a way to declutter my closet and earn some extra cash, but I soon realized there was a strong demand for the items I was selling. As sales increased, so did my following on Instagram, and I quickly grew a sizable platform. After selling most of my personal items, people started reaching out to me, asking if I could sell their clothes as well, since I had built a larger audience. This led to a thriving commission-based business where I helped others sell their clothes and earned a 25-30% commission.
                I started thrift selling back in my home country, Nepal, where reselling was still a relatively new concept. Due to the limited competition, my business grew rapidly, and I became one of the few people offering such services.</p>

                <p>I successfully commenced and operated a retail and thrifting business on Instagram. Through commission-based sales, I generated revenue by unique items that appealed to my target audience. I focused on enhancing the shop's online visibility by implementing strategic marketing initiatives. I also optimized pricing structures and employed upselling techniques, which resulted in a 25% increase in profit margins.</p>
