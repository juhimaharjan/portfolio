            <h2>My Experience in Audit<h2>
            <h3>Audit Intern:</h3>
            <p>I individually performed audits for corporate, international, and non-profit clients. Local non-profit clients mostly based on Washington DC. </p>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href="https://www.grfcpa.com/" target="_blank">GRF CPAs & Advisors</a>.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Audit Testing</h3>
                <p>I independently conducted audits for various financial areas, including payroll, credit cards, accounts payable, cash receipts and disbursements, prepaid, and accruals. This work was performed for corporate, international, and non-profit clients, ensuring accurate financial reporting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>I documented key risks during walkthroughs and field testing, identifying potential discrepancies. Using tools like CaseWare and Excel, I performed materiality testing to support accurate and reliable audit conclusions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3> Internal Controls and Compliance</h3>
                <p>I conducted internal control tests to assess compliance with GAAP standards, resolving discrepancies and ensuring clients adhered to established accounting principles.</p>
            </div>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                One of the clients I worked closely with during my audit internship was the  <a href="https://janegoodall.org/" target="_blank"> Jane Goodall Foundation</a>, renowned for their long-term research on chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. I had the opportunity to perform audit testing, conduct risk assessments, and assist with forming audit opinions for the foundation. At the conclusion of my internship, I was able to present a comprehensive audit report on the foundation and its financials. In addition to the Jane Goodall Foundation, I also contributed to the audit reports of several other organizations, expanding my experience across various industries.
