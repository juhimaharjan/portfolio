              <h2>My Experience in Tax<h2>
            <h3>Tax Intern:</h3>
            <p>I conducted tax for non-profit organization, individual income, and nonresident alien. </p>
            <p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href="https://www.grfcpa.com/" target="_blank">GRF CPAs & Advisors</a>.</p>
            p><strong>Company:</strong> <a href="https://www.sbdcgannon.org/" target="_blank">Gannon Small Business Development Center</a>.</p>

                <p>As an international student, my first experience with tax was challenging. The first time I did my taxes, I filled out as a resident, rather than using the 1040-NR for non-residents. Despite being an accounting student, my freshman knowledge was limited, and I had to research extensively to file the 1040-X. While I eventually resolved it thanks to my background in accounting, I noticed so many international students faced similar issues annually. With little support from the university, I started helping students with their tax forms, guided by a CPA and my professors.</p>

                <h3>Tax Intern</h3>
                <p>At my time at GRF CPAs & Advisors as an audit intern, I also got the opportunity to worked on tax returns specifically for nonprofit organizations. I assisted in filling necessary tax forms focusing on Form 990, Form 990-EZ, and Form 990-PF.</p>

                <h3>Tax Volunteer</h3>
                <p>I assisted local residents in Erie in filing their income tax along with GSBD's assistance program. It mostly helps elderly people or those who face challenges in filing their taxes themselves. </p>
